# Compiler-Construction-2024
Compiler ive developed on for the course IN5380(formally called INF5110) at the university of Oslo. The initial skeleton code for this project was developed by Martin Steffen (msteffen@ifi.uio.no), who retains the copyright to this code.

I would like to acknowledge Professor Martin Steffen’s dedication to research and teaching, and his substantial contributions to this course and many others. Martin passed away in late 2025, and his work continues to have a lasting impact on students at the University of Oslo.
