\section{Official }
\label{sec:official-info}




\hrulefill{}

The \textbf{deadline/frist}  for the second oblig is

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{\deadlinetwo}
\end{quote}






In this handout, I refer to information in files and directories. Part of
the information is contained in the \textbf{git-repository} that you have
cloned for the first oblig already (though it was not relevant at that
time, and I adapted the documentation like this handout and the slides to
the 2023 round in the meantime).

I refer to the root of the repos as 
\begin{quote}
  \texttt{<COMPILAROOT>}.   
\end{quote}
On the net, it corresponds to the browsable version in the repository
hosted by github under

\begin{quote}
  \texttt{https://github.uio.no/compilerconstruction-inf5110/compila}
\end{quote}

In your own \textbf{working directory,} it will probably carry the name
\texttt{compila00-<xx>}, unless you have chosen to rename it.




\section{What and how to hand in}
\label{sec:what-how}


\subsection{Git}
\label{sec:git}

You will continue with your group's git-repos you used in the first oblig.
Basically, you continue with your previous code, add the new functionality,
push a solution before the deadline, and inform me when it's done so that I
can update. It's important to tell me, as I don't want to repeatedly update
in the hope that it's done.

In case your previous code of oblig 1 was not fully functional, you of
course get first the parser in a workable state.


If a change in arrangement is needed (merge of groups, or a split of
groups), you need to ask for that re-arrangement (not just that on the day
of the deadline it's ``announced'' that there is now a new group \ldots).



See also the \emph{Readme} of the \emph{``patch''} under

\begin{quote}
  \url{<COMPILAROOT>/oblig2patch/oblig2patch/Readme.org}
\end{quote}


\subsection{What to include into a solution}
\label{sec:what-include-into}

As before, it should be an appropriately commented repos, solving the tasks
of oblig 2. In particular needed is (basically as before)


\begin{itemize}
\item A top-level \emph{Readme-file}\footnote{Many did a \texttt{Readme.md}
    which is a good format.} containing
  \begin{itemize}
  \item containing names and emails of the authors (as before)
  \item instructions how to build the compiler and how to run it (as
    before).
  \item test-output for running the compiler on \texttt{compila.cmp} as
    input
  \item of course, all code needed to run your solution 
  \item the Java-classes for the syntax-tree
  \item the build-script \texttt{build.xml} (adapted)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Of course, the old code (for lex and yacc-based parsing) is still
needed. It's not needed that both versions of the grammar, required for
oblig 1, are still supported, one working version is enough.



\section{Purpose and goal}
\label{sec:x}

The goal of the task is to collect more practical experience implementing a
compiler, in particular, a taste of phases after parsing. It's only a
taste, as we don't have the time to get a full-scale compiler on its
feet. The language we are compiling is (as before) described in the
\textbf{compila 23 language specification.} This time, also the later
sections about type checking etc, that were irrelevant for oblig 1, specify
the scope of the task as far as the language features are concerned.


Testing becomes more important than in oblig 1. It's \emph{necessary} that
a solution is equipped


\begin{quote}
  with ``automatic test-cases''
\end{quote}

That can be done (as before) via ant targets. Those tests have to be
executable on the RHEL linux pool at the university.\footnote{That should
  actually not be a big restriction, as Java (and the task) is to a big
  extent platform independent (``write once, run everywhere''
  \ldots). Nonetheless: Based on experience with the earlier years (this
  year actually no real problems occured on my side in oblig 1, though some
  group reported that internally they had to struggle with compatibility
  issues of unknown nature): it's advised to make this ``test'' setup early
  on (not after the deadline), to design the code \emph{with the goal that
    it runs also at a different place than one's own platform} and to test
  that this goal is actually met. The reason for that ``testability''
  requirement is that correction will again not be based on reading much
  code from my side, but in first approximation: running the test. In that
  sense, it's also not of primary importance, whether it's \texttt{ant} or
  perhaps \emph{make} or some script. Important is, that I can execute it
  by invoking a simple command.  I don't have the time to figure out how
  one particular solution is configured, started, etc. I don't even want to
  look around and try whether I find a \texttt{main} method somewhere\ldots
}


\section{Tools}
%\label{sec:tools}


The tools are basically the same as for the previous oblig, and typically
you will continue anyway with the previous set-up. 




\section{Task more specifically: Type checking and code generation}
\label{sec:task-more-spec}



The task is to extend the parser and AST generation with type checking and
code generation. The rules governing the type checking and other
restrictions are described in the language specification already (in the
later sections). The ``semantics'' is \emph{not} specified, but the
language is so simple that it should basically be clear what a compila
program is supposed to do.

The target ``platform'' is described in a separate document (which was
already made available as part of the git-repos). It's also browsable under


\begin{quote}
  \url{<COMPILAROOT>/doc/bytecodeinterpreter/bytecodeinterpreter.pdf}
\end{quote}

%\begin{quote}
%  \url{https://github.uio.no/compilerconstruction-inf5110/compila/tree/master/doc/bytecodeinterpreter}
%\end{quote}





\subsection*{Tests}
\label{sec:tests}

The tests that need to be successfully run for oblig 2 are
\begin{enumerate}
\item testing the type checker resp. semantic analysis
\item testing the code coge generator
\end{enumerate}


The tests are located as follows relative to the
\texttt{COMPILAROOT}-directory

\begin{verbatim}
   ./src/tests/semanticanalysis/
\end{verbatim}


\begin{verbatim}
   ./src/tests/fullprograms/runme.cmp
\end{verbatim}


They are already contained in \textbf{your git-repos} at the descibed
places (unless you have reorganized it).

\subsection*{Patch}
\label{sec:patch}


Obtain the patch (as zip-archive) under  (change)

\begin{quote}
  \url{https://github.uio.no/compilerconstruction-inf5110/compila/tree/master/oblig2patch/oblig2patch.zip}
\end{quote}

or via an \emph{updated} clone of the course repos. Read also the
~Readme.org~ there, there is more info about how to start. Note: when you
cloned or downloaded the repository in perhaps Februrary there had been
already some \emph{oblig2patch} as part of the repos. Also that should be
more or less usable, but it reflects the \textbf{2022 version}. Not much
has changed since then (mostly the documentation like this \textbf{handout}
here and the \emph{slides}, the actual ``content'' is basically the same.

Here is an overview over the structure of the new stuff:


\begin{verbatim}
  oblig2patch/
  oblig2patch/src/
  oblig2patch/src/test-asinspiration/
  oblig2patch/src/test-asinspiration/Tester.java
  oblig2patch/src/test-asinspiration/FileEndingFilter.java
  oblig2patch/src/compiler/
  oblig2patch/src/compiler/Compiler.java
  oblig2patch/doc/
  oblig2patch/doc/obligs/
  oblig2patch/doc/obligs/handout-oblig2.pdf
  oblig2patch/doc/obligs/slides-oblig2.pdf
  oblig2patch/Readme.org
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{Why is it called patch?}
\label{sec:why-it-called}

It's called patch, because your compiler needs not just \emph{new classes}
for instance for type checking, some already existing files also need
adaptation and changes. For oblig 1, I provided for example a file
\texttt{Compiler.java}, most took it as starting point (but may have
adapted it as well). Since I have no control what individual groups did
with that file I cannot hand out a \textbf{actual patch} in the technical
sense. Instead, I give a \emph{new version} of \texttt{Compiler.java} as
part of the patch-package, that should be used as \textbf{inpiration} of
what probably needs to be adapted in your version. The files
\texttt{Tester.java} and \texttt{FileEndingsFilter.java} are meant to be
used for testing, in particular to \textbf{automate} the tests
provided. Again, since I don't control how you solved oblig 1, it's
possible that they require adapdation. At least they need to be integrated
to your implemantation, i.e., moved out from the silly directory
\emph{oblig2patch} to a better suited place (and integrated into your
build-set-up).
